Show off your website visitors on the world map. When people around the world visit your blog, the corresponding areas on the heat map widget light up!

== Description ==

The PulseMaps plugin visualizes your site visitors' locations on the world map.  The plugin includes a map widget which you place on the pages you want to track.  The areas where you get the most visitors are shown with a lighter color.  The most recent visitors are show as flashing dots on the map.  The total number of visits is also shown.

For a live demo, visit the [PulseMaps website](http://pulsemaps.com/) and the [detail page for PulseMap website visitors](http://pulsemaps.com/maps/526958181/).

Simply drop the widget on your blog's sidebar. The map widget will work as a form of “social proof” : your visitors see that your blog is being read by people all over the world. This makes your blog instantly more trustworthy–who would trust a blog nobody reads? With this widget, you show readers that your site DOES get visitors. As an added bonus, the map just looks pretty dang cool!

Click on the widget to get to a detail page sporting a huge map which can be freely zoomed and panned, along with other interesting details and statistics.

The widget size and colors are fully customizable; you can choose any colors and size you wish on the admin panel.
